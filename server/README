How to:

1. Install required gems
  $ bundle install
  OR
  $ bundle install --without development

2. Run server
  $ ruby server.rb

Testing:

You will need Mocha and rake.
If you have installed the development group with bundle install, everything should be installed already.

Then you can test using rake:

rake test               # Test everything
rake test:unit          # Test units
rake test:integration   # Test integration
rake test:handlers      # Test handlers
