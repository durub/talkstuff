Writing handlers

  Writing handlers is so easy.
  There's only one thing to add: action number handlers
  These are done using the "handle" class method. See the example for details. Available to you in the block there's payload, which
  contains the payload sent in the packet (the data after the protocol magic number and action number).
  Another important method is the answer_with. It is used to answer to an packet, generally a request.
  The answer_with call goes like this:
    * Reads :protocol_magic_number (optional), if it's a byte, it changes the protocol magic number in the data_string, originally determined
    by the PacketDispatcher. If it's false, it excludes the protocol magic number from the data_string. If it's not entered, it maintains the
    original PacketDispatcher magic_number. Anyway, :protocol_magic_number gets deleted from the *args Hash.
    * Reads :action_number and deletes it from the *args Hash. If it's not present, it's calculated as (ActionNumberBeingHandled + 1). If it
    should be different from that, you must explicity define it. See the example below, NEW_ADMIN_SESSION can omit the :action_number because
    his action number is 0x11, and the answer action number is 0x12. However, NEW_SESSION can't because if it did, it would send a NEW_ADMIN_SESSION
    to the client (0x10 + 1 = 0x11, NEW_ADMIN_SESSION).
    * Reads :payload and deletes it from the *args Hash. Then, it gets appended to the data_string.
    * Reads any other data present in the *args Hash, discards the key and appends the value to the data_string.
    * Send the data_string to the user

  Note:
    :payload is optional and can be used as a replacement for the hash setup. See these examples:
      # These three are all equal (at least they should ;-))
      answer_with :my_string => "my string"
      answer_with :payload => "my string"
      answer_with :payload => "my ", :name => "string"

      # These two are also equal
      answer_with :success => 1, :user_id => 0, :username => "John"
      answer_with :payload => [1, 0, "John"]

  Example of a handler:
    # Action numbers definitions (optional, but improves readability)
    NEW_SESSION = 0x10
    NEW_ADMIN_SESSION = 0x11
    ANS_NEW_SESSION = 0x12

    # Error codes (optional, but improves readability)
    INVALID_KEY = 0x666

    class SessionHandler < PacketHandler
      handle NEW_SESSION do
        answer_with :action_number => ANS_NEW_SESSION, :success => 1, :user_id => 0
      end

      handle NEW_ADMIN_SESSION do
        secret_key = payload[0][0]

        if $admin_keys.include?(secret_key)
          answer_with :success => 1, :user_id => 0
        else
          answer_with :success => 0, :error_code => INVALID_KEY
        end
      end
    end

Writing handlers tests

  Handlers tests are placed in the "tests/handlers" folder. They should be named in the following form: HandlerName + Test.
  A handler named "Session" (SessionHandler) should have his test named "SessionTest". This is important for the get_handler_name method.
  These tests must inherit from the HandlerTest class, which provides some convenience methods:

  should_answer_with
    Tests "answer_it" calls. should_answer_with behaves the same as answer_with; call it the same way you would call answer_with.
    Each should_answer_with should have at most one call_handler_for call.

    Example:
      # Inside of GET_MY_USER_ID handler there should be a
      # "answer_with :user_id => 0" call
      should_answer_with :user_id => 0
      call_handler_for GET_MY_USER_ID # where the actual testing occurs

  call_handler_for
    Calls the handler for the specified action number. Arguments can be specified. (payload)

    Example:
      call_handler_for OPEN_SESSION
      call_handler_for LOGIN, "myusername", "password"
                                    |            |
                                    -------------------> payload

  get_handler_name
    Gets the name of the handler class. This method uses the test name to translate it to a handler name.
    SessionTest -> SessionHandler
    RoomTest -> RoomHandler

    Other convenience methods depends on this method. The name of your test class is important.

    Example:
      class LoginTest < HandlerTest
        def test_convenience
          assert_equal "LoginHandler", get_handler_name # true
        end
      end

  get_handler_class
    Gets the handler class constant.
    Other convenience methods depends on this method.

    Example:
      class LoginTest < HandlerTest
        def test_convenience
          assert_equal "LoginHandler", get_handler_class.name # true
        end
      end
